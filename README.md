# nopcommerce_automation_test
A Selenium WebDriver automation test project for nopCommerce. This repository serves as a hands-on learning project where I practice and showcase my automation skills by building a structured Page Object Model (POM) framework, writing reusable test scripts, and applying best practices in automated testing.
